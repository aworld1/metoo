            <p>Women are 35% more likely than men to live in poverty.
            <br/>- 1 in 8 women lived in poverty in 2015.

            <br/>- Of the nation’s 14.5 million poor children, more than half live in families headed by women.
            <br/>Women are not paid equally relative to men, and therefore experience this hardship.
            <br/>According to the source, "reducing poverty for women will require us to invest in support systems,

           <p>Shocking statistics directs society's attention to domestic violence. These statistics, according to the source, are:
           <br/>- 4 in 5 victims of domestic violence are women.
           <br/>- Each year, 4.7 million American women experience physical violence by an intimate partner.
           <br/>- 3 women on average are murdered by a boyfriend or husband each day.
           <br/>- Domestic violence costs the economy between $10-67 billion each year in health care services and lost worker productivity.
           <br/><br/>This new research that shows gender roles in domestic abuse pressures society into staying away from such violence in future events and encounters.</p>

            <br/>The source cited shows breathtaking analytics that most people are ignorant of:
            <br/>- Out of every 1,000 rapes, 994 perpetrators will walk free.
            <br/>- 2 out of 3 rapes are never reported to the police (typically because the victim fears retaliation or that they won’t be believed).
            <br/>The source proves that woman's rights remain in jeopardy to-date, and that actions must be taken in order to secure the rights.</p>
